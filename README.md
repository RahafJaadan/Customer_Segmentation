# Customer_Segmentation

## Overview 
This project performs data analysis and visualization using Python libraries and applies unsupervised machine learning algorithms for clustering. We utilize popular data science libraries to explore the dataset, uncover patterns, and generate insights. 

## Libraries Used
* **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
* **NumPy**: Numerical computations. 
* **Seaborn**: Statistical data visualization.
* **Matplotlib**: Plotting and visualizations.

## Machine Learning Algorithms
We applied unsupervised learning algorithms to cluster the dataset:
* **K-Means Clustering**
* **Hierarchical Clustering**
* **DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)**

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository:

 ```git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git```
   
2. Install required libraries:

```pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn```
   
3. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script to perform analysis:
  
``` jupyter notebook analysis.ipynb```

## Results 
The results of clustering are visualized using Seaborn and Matplotlib, showing distinct clusters in the data.
